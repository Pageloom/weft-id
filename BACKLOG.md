## Create `/accessibility` Skill

**User Story:**
As a developer,
I want an `/accessibility` skill that audits the frontend for WCAG 2.1 AA compliance,
So that accessibility issues are identified and tracked systematically like security and compliance violations.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] New skill file at `.claude/skills/accessibility/` following the pattern of existing skills
- [ ] Skill audits Jinja2 templates for WCAG 2.1 AA violations (missing alt text, insufficient contrast cues, missing form labels, ARIA misuse, keyboard navigation gaps, missing lang attributes, missing focus indicators)
- [ ] Skill logs findings to `ISSUES.md` in the same format as `/security` and `/compliance`
- [ ] Skill references a checklist in `.claude/references/wcag-patterns.md`
- [ ] Skill can be invoked with `/accessibility` from Claude Code

**Effort:** M
**Value:** Medium

## Dyslexic-Friendly Font User Preference

**User Story:**
As a user with dyslexia,
I want to enable a dyslexic-friendly font in my account settings,
So that the interface is more readable for me without affecting other users.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] A font preference field is added to the user profile (boolean, default false)
- [ ] Database migration adds the column to the `users` table
- [ ] User can toggle the preference in their profile/settings page
- [ ] When enabled, the selected dyslexic-friendly font (e.g. OpenDyslexic or Atkinson Hyperlegible) is applied via a CSS class on the `<html>` or `<body>` element
- [ ] Font is served from static assets (not an external CDN) for privacy and reliability
- [ ] Preference persists across sessions (stored server-side)
- [ ] **No audit log** for this write (follows the `save_graph_layout()` pattern: it is UI preference state, not a business action). The service function docstring must note this explicitly.
- [ ] `track_activity()` is called (instead of `log_event()`) so the user's `last_activity_at` is still updated
- [ ] API endpoint exposes the preference for programmatic access

**Effort:** M
**Value:** Medium

## Admin: Super Admin Debug Impersonation

**User Story:**
As a super admin
I want to view what a specific user's application access looks like from their perspective
So that I can debug access and attribute issues without creating a real session as that user

**Context:**

This is a debug-only, read-only capability. The super admin sees the user's effective access
and the identity attributes that would be asserted for them, without performing a real
authentication to any SP. This is the "what would happen if they logged in?" companion to
the User-App Access Query item, which answers "does this user have access?".

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Super admin only (not admin role)
- [ ] Accessible from the user detail page and/or the User-App Access view
- [ ] Shows the user's effective group memberships and the SPs accessible via those groups
- [ ] For a selected user + SP combination, shows a preview of the identity attributes
      (name, email, groups, any custom attribute mappings) that would be asserted
- [ ] Clearly labeled as a debug preview. No actual SP session or authentication occurs.
- [ ] Event logged in audit trail (`super_admin_debug_impersonation`) with actor, target user, and SP

**Effort:** M
**Value:** Low

## Self-Updating Management Script and Env Var Diffing

**User Story:**
As a self-hosting operator upgrading to a new version
I want the management script to update itself and tell me about new configuration variables
So that I don't miss required settings or run stale management tooling

**Context:**

The `weftid` management script is downloaded once during install and never updated. New versions
may add subcommands, change upgrade behavior, or introduce new `.env` variables. Today the
operator has no way to discover this except reading the changelog.

Two related problems to solve:

1. **Self-updating `weftid`:** During `./weftid upgrade`, after pulling the new image but before
   restarting, download the matching `weftid` script from GitHub (same tag as the target version)
   and overwrite the local copy. The current version's upgrade flow runs to completion using the
   old script. The next command uses the new one. No mid-execution weirdness.

2. **Env var diffing:** After pulling the new image, extract `.env.production.example` from it
   (`docker compose run --rm app cat /app/.env.production.example`), diff the keys against the
   current `.env`, and show any new variables with their descriptions and defaults. Per
   `VERSIONING.md`, minor versions add vars with sensible defaults (informational). Major versions
   may add required vars without defaults (blocking).

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] `./weftid upgrade` downloads the new `weftid` script from GitHub after pulling the image
- [ ] The old script completes the upgrade before being overwritten
- [ ] `./weftid upgrade` extracts `.env.production.example` from the new image
- [ ] New env vars are shown to the operator with descriptions and default values
- [ ] Required vars without defaults block the upgrade until the operator adds them to `.env`
- [ ] Optional vars with defaults are informational (operator can accept defaults or customize)

**Effort:** M
**Value:** High
