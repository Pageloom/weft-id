## Service Read Functions Missing track_activity() Calls

**Status:** Resolved (2025-12-22)

**Found in:** `app/services/users.py`, `app/services/settings.py`, `app/services/mfa.py`, `app/services/emails.py`

**Severity:** Medium

**Description:** The backlog for User Activity Tracking states "Any service layer read operation updates `last_activity_at` only if 3+ hours have passed" and "Read operations require explicit `track_activity()` calls". However, service functions that receive `RequestingUser` and perform read operations did NOT call `track_activity()`.

**Affected functions:**
- `services/users.py`: `list_users()`, `get_user()`, `get_current_user_profile()`
- `services/settings.py`: `list_privileged_domains()`, `get_security_settings()`
- `services/mfa.py`: `get_mfa_status()`, `get_backup_codes_status()`
- `services/emails.py`: `list_user_emails()`

**Resolution:** Added `track_activity(requesting_user["tenant_id"], requesting_user["id"])` at the start of each read-only service function that receives a `RequestingUser`.

## Service Functions Missing Activity/Event Tracking (Backstop Test Findings)

**Status:** Resolved (2025-12-22)

**Found in:** `app/services/emails.py`, `app/services/mfa.py`

**Severity:** Low

**Description:** Two service functions with `RequestingUser` parameter were missing required tracking calls:

1. `services.emails.resend_verification()` - Read-like operation that returns email info for resending verification. Should call `track_activity()`.

2. `services.mfa.setup_totp()` - Write operation that generates and stores a new TOTP secret. Should call `log_event()`.

**Resolution:**
- Added `track_activity()` call to `resend_verification()`
- Added `log_event()` call with event_type `totp_setup_initiated` to `setup_totp()`
- Removed exemptions from backstop test `test_all_service_functions_have_activity_or_logging`
