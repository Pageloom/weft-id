## API-First Architecture: RESTful API Layer with OpenAPI Specification

**User Story:**
As a developer integrating with the identity platform
I want a comprehensive RESTful API with OAuth2 authentication and OpenAPI specification
So that I can build custom applications and integrations without relying on server-side rendered pages

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**API Coverage:**
- [ ] All post-authentication functionality exposed via RESTful APIs
- [x] User management endpoints (CRUD operations)
- [x] User profile endpoints (view/edit profile, title, organizational placement)
- [x] Settings management endpoints (privileged domains, tenant settings)
- [ ] Organizational structure endpoints (view hierarchy, manage units - admin only)
- [ ] Ad-hoc groups endpoints (create, manage, invite members)
- [x] Role and permission management endpoints
- [x] Pre-authentication flows (login, registration) remain server-side rendered (excluded from API)
- [x] Email verification flows remain server-side rendered (excluded from API)

**Authentication & Authorization:**
- [x] OAuth2 authentication for API access
- [x] Support for B2B client-credentials flow
- [x] API endpoints respect existing role-based permissions (Super Admin, Admin, User)
- [x] Token-based authentication for all API requests
- [x] Secure token storage and refresh mechanisms

**OpenAPI Specification:**
- [x] Auto-generated OpenAPI 3.x specification from FastAPI
- [x] Bare-bones spec (endpoint paths, methods, request/response schemas)
- [x] No detailed descriptions or examples required (minimal documentation)
- [x] Specification available at `/openapi.json` endpoint
- [x] Interactive API docs available at `/docs` (Swagger UI)
- [x] Specification covers all implemented API endpoints
- [x] Exclude HTML/server-rendered endpoints from OpenAPI spec (only include `/api/v1/*` routes)
- [x] Document security/authentication requirements per endpoint in OpenAPI spec

**API Testing Strategy:**
- [ ] Automated test generation based on OpenAPI specification
- [ ] Tests validate all endpoints defined in the OpenAPI spec
- [x] Tests cover: request/response schemas, HTTP status codes, authentication requirements
- [x] Tests verify role-based permission enforcement for each endpoint
- [x] Tests ensure tenant isolation for multi-tenant endpoints
- [ ] Contract testing: ensure API implementation matches OpenAPI spec
- [ ] Tool/library selection for spec-driven testing (e.g., `schemathesis`, `dredd`, or custom pytest-based approach)
- [x] Integration with existing pytest test suite
- [ ] CI/CD integration to run spec-based tests automatically

**Architecture:**
- [x] Existing server-side rendered pages remain untouched (no breaking changes)
- [x] New API routes organized under `/api/v1/` prefix
- [x] API responses return JSON with consistent error handling
- [x] Proper HTTP status codes for all responses
- [x] Tenant isolation maintained for all API endpoints (via `tenant_id`)

**Out of Scope:**
- SDK generation (can be done separately using OpenAPI spec)
- Rate limiting
- CORS configuration (handled at server/reverse proxy level)
- Migration of existing server-side pages to API-driven SPAs
- Detailed API documentation or examples
- GraphQL or other API paradigms

**Technical Implementation:**
- New router module: `app/routers/api/` directory structure
- API versioning: `/api/v1/` prefix for all endpoints
- OAuth2 implementation using FastAPI's security utilities
- Token management database tables (migrations required)
- Leverage existing `app/database/` modules for data access
- Update FastAPI app configuration for OpenAPI generation
- API-specific error handling and response formatting
- Spec-based testing framework setup in `tests/api/` directory
- Test configuration to load and parse OpenAPI spec
- Test fixtures for OAuth2 token generation and multi-role testing

**Dependencies:**
- FastAPI OAuth2 utilities (already available)
- Potential OAuth2 library (e.g., `authlib` or `python-jose`)
- Spec-based testing library (e.g., `schemathesis`, `dredd`, or custom pytest solution)

**Effort:** XL (3-4 weeks for complete coverage including testing)
**Value:** High (Foundation for Ecosystem Growth & Integrations)

**Notes:**
- This creates a parallel API layer alongside existing server-side pages
- Future epic can migrate pages to consume these APIs
- OpenAPI spec enables third-party SDK generation
- Spec-driven testing ensures API contract stability
- Maintains backward compatibility with current functionality
- **Detailed implementation plan:** See [docs/api-implementation-plan.md](docs/api-implementation-plan.md)

## Organizational Structure & Grouping System

**User Story:**
As an admin or user of the identity platform
I want to organize people into flexible hierarchical structures and ad-hoc groups
So that downstream applications can bootstrap teams, channels, and access controls based on organizational context

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Hierarchical Organizational Structure:**
- [ ] Support 1-6 levels of organizational hierarchy (hard cap at 6 levels)
- [ ] Each level has a customizable type name (e.g., "Organization", "Business Unit", "Department", "Team")
- [ ] Default level names: Organization → Business Unit → Department → Team
- [ ] Admins can rename level types (e.g., "Business Unit" → "Division")
- [ ] Each organizational unit within a level has its own name (e.g., "Engineering Department", "Platform Team")
- [ ] Organizations can skip levels (e.g., Organization → Team directly)
- [ ] Users can belong to multiple organizational units across different branches simultaneously
- [ ] All users can view the complete organizational structure
- [ ] Only Super Admins and Admins can create/edit/delete organizational units
- [ ] Only Super Admins and Admins can add/remove people to/from organizational units

**Ad-hoc Groups:**
- [ ] Any user can create ad-hoc groups (e.g., "Security Champions", "Project Phoenix")
- [ ] Group creator sets visibility: Public (visible to all) or Private (visible to members only)
- [ ] Group creator can invite and uninvite members
- [ ] Other users can invite to ad-hoc groups but cannot uninvite (unless they're admins)
- [ ] Super Admins and Admins can see all ad-hoc groups regardless of visibility
- [ ] Super Admins and Admins can manage membership and change visibility of any ad-hoc group
- [ ] Regular users see: public groups + private groups they're members of
- [ ] Ad-hoc groups transcend hierarchical boundaries (cross-functional)

**User Profile & Titles:**
- [ ] Users can have an optional "title" field (e.g., "Senior Engineer", "VP of Sales")
- [ ] All users can view their own organizational placement (units and groups)
- [ ] User profile displays: hierarchical placement(s), ad-hoc group memberships, and title
- [ ] Existing roles (Super Admin, Admin, User) remain unchanged - they control IdP permissions only

**API/Data Exposure:**
- [ ] API endpoints to query organizational structure
- [ ] API endpoints to list members of any organizational unit or group
- [ ] Enable downstream applications to consume org structure (e.g., auto-create chat channels)
- [ ] Future: Support syncing org structure from upstream IdPs (optional input) - not in MVP

**Out of Scope (for MVP):**
- Manager-employee relationship tracking
- Reporting structure and approval chains
- Org chart visualization UI
- Bulk import of organizational structure
- Syncing from upstream IdPs (Okta, Azure AD, etc.)
- Organizational unit permissions/access control within the IdP

**Technical Implementation:**
- Database migration: New tables for org units, org levels, groups, memberships
- Database schema:
  - `org_levels`: id, tenant_id, level_number (1-6), level_name, created_at
  - `org_units`: id, tenant_id, level_id, parent_unit_id, name, created_at
  - `org_memberships`: user_id, org_unit_id, joined_at
  - `groups`: id, tenant_id, name, is_public, creator_user_id, created_at
  - `group_memberships`: user_id, group_id, joined_at
- New router: `app/routers/organization.py`
- New database module: `app/database/organization.py`
- Update user profile endpoints to include org data
- UI pages for managing org structure (admin only)
- UI for creating/managing ad-hoc groups (all users)
- UI for viewing org structure (all users)

**Dependencies:**
- None (pure backend/database work)

**Effort:** XL (2-3 weeks)
**Value:** High (Core MVP Feature - Foundation for IdP)

**Notes:**
- This is foundational for the MVP identity platform
- Enables downstream applications to leverage organizational context
- Flexible enough to support various org models (flat to deeply nested)
- Balance between admin control (hierarchy) and user empowerment (ad-hoc groups)
- Data model should be extensible for future upstream IdP sync

## Privileged Domain Verification via DNS TXT Records

**User Story:**
As a super admin
I want to verify ownership of privileged email domains via DNS TXT records
So that only domains I actually control can bypass email verification, preventing security vulnerabilities

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Super admin can add privileged domains which are created in an "unverified" state
- [ ] System generates a unique verification token (32-char random string) for each domain
- [ ] UI displays verification instructions: "Add this TXT record to your DNS: `loom-verify=<token>`"
- [ ] "Verify Domain" button triggers on-demand DNS TXT record lookup
- [ ] When matching TXT record is found, domain is marked as verified with timestamp
- [ ] Unverified domains are visible but marked as "pending verification"
- [ ] Regular admins can view privileged domains and their verification status (read-only)
- [ ] Periodic background job re-verifies all verified domains (e.g., daily/weekly)
- [ ] If re-verification fails, domain status changes to "verification failed" (with alert/notification)
- [ ] Auto-verification of new user emails works regardless of domain verification status (future features may restrict this)
- [ ] Users who were previously verified remain verified even if domain verification later fails
- [ ] Database tracks: verification_token, verified (boolean), verified_at (timestamp)

**Technical Implementation:**
- Database migration: `00009_domain_verification.sql`
- DNS utility: `app/utils/dns.py` (using dnspython package)
- Update: `app/database/settings.py`
- New endpoint: verification route in settings router
- UI updates: settings template showing verification status and instructions
- Background job: domain re-verification cron task

**Dependencies:**
- `dnspython` package

**Effort:** L (4-6 hours)
**Value:** High (Security)

## Multi-Region Tenant Routing Infrastructure

**User Story:**
As a platform operator
I want to route tenant requests to their assigned datacenter based on subdomain
So that I can guarantee data residency in specific regions and enable future geographic distribution

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Global routing layer (Cloudflare Workers or similar) intercepts all `*.pageloom.com` requests
- [ ] Routing layer queries tenant-to-region mapping to determine which datacenter hosts the tenant
- [ ] Requests are proxied/routed to the appropriate regional application instance
- [ ] Tenant-to-region mapping service is lightweight and globally accessible (e.g., Cloudflare KV, global database, or API)
- [ ] Each tenant is permanently assigned to one region (tenant-pinned strategy)
- [ ] Support for manually moving a tenant to a different region (updates mapping, data migration handled separately)
- [ ] All tenant data is isolated by `tenant_id` (already implemented) to enable clean regional separation
- [ ] Health checks and fallback routing if a region is unavailable
- [ ] Documentation on how to add a new region to the infrastructure
- [ ] Wildcard SSL certificate for `*.pageloom.com` configured

**Out of Scope (for this item):**
- Actual data migration tooling when moving tenants between regions
- GDPR/compliance documentation
- Multi-region database replication

**Technical Implementation:**
- Cloudflare DNS with wildcard SSL (`*.pageloom.com`)
- Cloudflare Workers for edge routing logic
- Tenant-to-region mapping store (recommend: Cloudflare KV or lightweight API)
- Regional application instances (DigitalOcean App Platform or Droplets)
- Update nginx/application configuration for region awareness
- Deployment automation for multiple regions

**Dependencies:**
- Cloudflare account with Workers capability
- Multiple DigitalOcean regions provisioned

**Effort:** XL (multi-week effort, significant infrastructure work)
**Value:** High (Scalability, Data Sovereignty)

**Notes:**
- Foundation for data residency guarantees
- Enables future compliance requirements (GDPR, etc.)
- Tenant IDs are globally unique, facilitating future tenant migrations
