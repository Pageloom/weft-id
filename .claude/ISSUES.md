## [REFACTOR] File Structure: groups/idp.py split candidate at 710 lines

**Found in:** `app/services/groups/idp.py`
**Impact:** Medium
**Category:** File Structure
**Description:** This file handles two distinct concerns: group creation/discovery (create_idp_base_group, get_or_create_idp_group, _ensure_umbrella_relationship, invalidate_idp_groups) and membership management (sync_user_idp_groups, ensure_user_in_base_group, remove_user_from_base_group, move_users_between_idps). At 710 lines with 15 public functions, it's at the limit of maintainability.
**Why It Matters:** The two concerns are intertwined but distinct. Splitting improves traversability and makes each module's purpose clear.
**Deferred reason:** The test suite patches `services.groups.idp.database` as a single mock to intercept calls across both lifecycle and membership functions. Splitting the module would require patching two submodules' `database` references in ~40 test locations, doubling mock boilerplate. The file should be split after refactoring tests to use proper fixtures.
**Suggested Refactoring:** Split into two modules within the existing groups package:
- `idp_lifecycle.py` (~350 lines): group lifecycle and discovery
- `idp_membership.py` (~350 lines): sync, base group membership, cross-IdP moves
**Files Affected:** `app/services/groups/idp.py`, `app/services/groups/__init__.py`, tests

## [BUG] UX: "Enable all" category checkbox on tenant attribute settings is misleading

**Found in:** `app/templates/settings_user_attributes.html` (tenant attribute config page, iter 3 of user_attributes feature)
**Impact:** Low
**Category:** UX
**Description:** Each category section (Contact, Professional, Location, Profile) has an "Enable all in [Category]" checkbox at the top. The checkbox renders as **checked** if any single attribute in the category is enabled, even though the label implies it reflects "all in this category enabled." Toggling it then enables/disables every row in the category, surprising users who only had one row enabled.
**Why It Matters:** The control's checked state does not match the meaning of the label, and clicking it can wipe out a deliberately partial selection.
**Suggested Fix:** Least-surprising option is to remove the category-level toggle entirely. Per-row checkboxes already cover the use case. If kept, change the control to a button (e.g., "Enable all" / "Disable all" buttons that always show both options) or change the checkbox to reflect "all enabled" precisely (only checked when every row is on, indeterminate when partial).
**Files Affected:** `app/templates/settings_user_attributes.html`, related JS in the same file.

## [REFACTOR] Duplication: Tab route pattern repeated 6x in saml_idp/admin.py

**Found in:** `app/routers/saml_idp/admin.py:225-436`
**Impact:** Low
**Category:** Duplication
**Description:** Six tab routes (sp_tab_details, sp_tab_attributes, sp_tab_groups, sp_tab_certificates, sp_tab_metadata, sp_tab_danger) follow an identical pattern: call `_load_sp_common()`, handle errors, build tab-specific context, return template response. The file is at 1089 lines with 33 route handlers.
**Why It Matters:** The repetitive pattern adds bulk, but the file is well-organized with clear section headers. This is low priority because each handler is compact (30-50 lines) and the structure is consistent.
**Accepted:** Each tab has genuinely different context loading logic. A generic helper would need callbacks that add complexity without improving readability. Monitor for further growth.
**Files Affected:** `app/routers/saml_idp/admin.py`
